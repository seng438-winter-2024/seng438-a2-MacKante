# 1. Introduction

This lab introduces of understanding Junit, Unit testing, and Black Box Testing and familarize with Testing tools and Real life systems like Eclipse and JFreeChart.

Our group is meant to design, develop, and implement unit tests for JFreeChart, a Java framework for chart calculation, creation, and display. Specifically, we write tests for 2 classes: Range and DataUtilities. First, we start by designing the test cases, dividing them into Equivalence Class Partitions and their boundaries, and also identifying edge cases for robustness testing. We then write unit tests to examine the state and behavior of the methods and find faults in the program.

In this lab, our group is meant to perform over 10 methods for both Range

Our initial knowledge of unit testing and BlackBox testing came from content covered in lectures, but also from ENSF 380, a 2nd year software engineering course which offered a brief introduction into unit testing with JUnit. The lectures explained that unit testing is a focused kind of testing, which is meant to test a single "unit" of the overall system at a time. This allows developers to find faults which are isolated to those units and correct them. BlackBox testing involves multiple strategies, namely Equivalence Class Partitioning, Boundary Value Testing, Robustness Testing, and Worst Case Testing. This lab also introduced us to mocking, allowing us to create mocked responses of external methods and classes in order to observe the behavior and state of the SUT.

# 2. Scope 

All testing will be done with black box techniques in mind. Techniques like boundary value analysis and equivalence partitioning.

We will be testing 5 out of 15 methods from org.jfree.data.Range and all 5 from org.jfree.data.DataUtilities. More specifically...

## DataUtilities
### static double calculateColumnTotal(Values2D data, int column)
Returns the sum of the values in one column of the supplied data table.

### static double calculateRowTotal(Values2D data, int row)
Returns the sum of the values in one row of the supplied data table.

### static java.lang.Number[] createNumberArray(double[] data)
Constructs an array of Number objects from an array of double primitives.

### static java.lang.Number[][] createNumberArray2D(double[][] data)
Constructs an array of arrays of Number objects from a corresponding structure containing double primitives.

### static KeyedValues getCumulativePercentages(KeyedValues data)
Returns a KeyedValues instance that contains the cumulative percentage values for the data in another KeyedValues instance.

## Range (5 of 15)
### boolean	contains(double value)
Returns true if the specified value is within the range and false otherwise.

### double	getCentralValue()
Returns the central (or median) value for the range.

### double	getLength()
Returns the length of the range.

### double	getLowerBound()
Returns the lower bound for the range.

### double	getUpperBound()
Returns the upper bound for the range.

# 3. Detailed description of unit test strategy

Our group has primarily focused on implementing black-box testing, where we design test cases based on the behaviour of the methods without looking into their internal workings. We identified equivalence classes and applied boundary value analysis to ensure comprehensive coverage of tests for both Range class and DataUtilities class.

We identified different equivalence classes based on different scenarios and inputs for each method. For our tests, we identified equivalence classes such as zero range, null range, positive/negative range boundaries, values on/around range boundaries, etc. For boundary value analysis, we considered values near the edges of the input domain for each method. Some of the boundary values we identified were values like zero, values around the upper/lower bound in range, etc.

## Small discussion on the usage of mocking

During the completion of this assignment, our group was exposed to the usage of mocking in unit tests, specifically JMock. It has been a useful tool that made the test methods creation much easier, but not without some difficulties and concerns.

### Benefits
- More control in specific test scenarios
- Easier to meet specific dependencies needed for some methods
- Isolation: removal of external dependencies

### Negatives
- Maintenance: our group had to revise mock code until it worked
- Too reliant/based on specific code: might break if code changes slightly
- Too complex for some cases, might be more simple if the relied upon dependencies are really basic and easy to implement

Overall, mocking has proved to be incredibly useful, it's benefits outweigh it's negatives and the use of it will make testing much easier. Perhaps our opinions are a bit biased as we had some difficulty in using JMock but we have no doubts that with more practice, mocking will be an essential tool when creating unit tests.

# 5. How the team work/effort was divided and managed

We read through the document and we divided the work for designing and creating test cases on both Range and DataUtilities. Here's how the methods to test were divided amongst group members:

Person 1: Nathan
- Range: getLowerBound
- Range: contains
- DataUtilities: createNumberArray2D

Person 2: Karam
- Range: getUpperBound
- DataUtilities: calculateColumnTotal
- DataUtilities: getCumulativePercentages

Person 3: Angelo
- Range: getCentralValue 
- DataUtilities: calculateRowTotal

Person 4: Dominic
- Range: getLength
- DataUtilities: createNumberArray

Each person was responsible for designing and implementing their unit tests. Once we all finished, we came together to combine our unit tests, ensuring they worked seamlessly together. 

# 6. Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

Troubles were had when setting up and using the Eclipse IDE for Java. None of us had much experience with it so we had to get accustomed to it and learn how to use the software and troubleshoot issues we came across.

Another issue encountered was thinking of good test cases for each method. Certain methods may be more difficult to test for different reasons such as mocking, and therefore require a more thoughtful approach to testing.

The usage of JMock also proved some difficulty, test methods required multiple changes until it stopped producing errors.

# 7. Comments/feedback on the lab itself

We believe the lab was an excellent introduction into Unit Testing with Java and Black Box testing, as well as a good way to start getting aquainted to JMock.
