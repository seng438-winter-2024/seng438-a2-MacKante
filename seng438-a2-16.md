# 1. Introduction

###### Talk about what lab is about, what it involves, and our knowledge of unit testing prior to this lab

# 2. Detailed description of unit test strategy

###### A detailed description of the testing strategy for unit testing and your test-case design approach, i.e., how you used the black-box test-case design techniques equivalence classes, and boundary value analysis. Also list the name of the test cases you have designed and identify which one covers which parts of the strategy (which partition, which class, etc.) Include a discussion about what you feel are the benefits and drawbacks about using mocking.

// including the input partitions you have designed

# 3. Test cases developed
## DataUtilities
### static double calculateColumnTotal(Values2D data, int column)
Returns the sum of the values in one column of the supplied data table.

### static double calculateRowTotal(Values2D data, int row)
Returns the sum of the values in one row of the supplied data table.

### static java.lang.Number[] createNumberArray(double[] data)
Constructs an array of Number objects from an array of double primitives.

### static java.lang.Number[][] createNumberArray2D(double[][] data)
Constructs an array of arrays of Number objects from a corresponding structure containing double primitives.

### static KeyedValues getCumulativePercentages(KeyedValues data)
Returns a KeyedValues instance that contains the cumulative percentage values for the data in another KeyedValues instance.

## Range (5 of 15)

### boolean	contains(double value)
Returns true if the specified value is within the range and false otherwise.

### boolean	equals(java.lang.Object obj)
Tests this object for equality with an arbitrary object.

### static Range expand(Range range, double lowerMargin, double upperMargin)
Creates a new range by adding margins to an existing range.

### static Range expandToInclude(Range range, double value)
Returns a range that includes all the values in the specified range AND contains the specified value.

### double	getCentralValue()
Returns the central (or median) value for the range.

### double	getLength()
Returns the length of the range.

### double	getLowerBound()
Returns the lower bound for the range.

### double	getUpperBound()
Returns the upper bound for the range.

### int	hashCode()
Returns a hash code.

### boolean	intersects(double lower, double upper)
Returns true if the range intersects (overlaps) with the specified range, and false otherwise.

### static Range	shift(Range base, double delta)
Returns a range the size of the input range, which has been moved positively (to the right) by the delta value.

### static Range	shift(Range base, double delta, boolean allowZeroCrossing)
Returns a range the size of the input range, which has been moved positively (to the right) by the delta value.

### java.lang.String	toString()
Returns a string representation of this Range.

// write down the name of the test methods and classes. Organize the based on
the source code method // they test. identify which tests cover which partitions
you have explained in the test strategy section //above
