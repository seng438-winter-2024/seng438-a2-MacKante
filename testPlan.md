# Test Plan

The objective of this test plan is to verify the correctness and functionality of the methods in org.jfree.data.DataUtilities and org.jfree.data.Range.

# Scope

All testing will be done with black box techniques in mind. Techniques like boundary value analysis and equivalence partitioning.

We will be testing 5 out of 15 methods from org.jfree.data.Range and all 5 from org.jfree.data.DataUtilities. More specifically...




# Strategy

Implement black box testing techniques, boundary value analysis and equivalence partitioning, to all methods.

Each method will be tested with positive and negative test cases to cover all possible scenarios.

# Test Environment

All tests will be done using JUnit testing framework for writing and executing test cases.

Eclipse IDE for Java Developers will be used to help with that.
